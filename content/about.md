Hi, I'm Jiwei Yuan, a programmer with experience in Java, Golang, and JavaScript. I graduated from [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/) in 2018.  Later, through self-teaching, I became a professional full-stack software engineer. After several years of work, I decided to return to university to pursue a Computer Science degree at the University of St Andrews(July 2023 to August 2024).

My primary focus has been on building enterprise SaaS products, but I also have a keen interest in IaaS and PaaS. In this blog, I’ll share my thoughts on these areas from various perspectives, including programming, product development, architecture, and engineering.

On a side note, I'm a pragmatic learning hacker, deeply curious about the science of learning and creativity. I’m always on the lookout for simple, high-ROI approaches to boost learning and productivity. I even built an app called [Remdraw](https://remdraw.com/) that turns whiteboard notes into flashcards to help people learn more effectively.

If you have any questions or just want to connect, feel free to reach out via email at ji-weiyuan[at]outlook.com or on Twitter: [@JiweiYuan](https://twitter.com/JiweiYuan). I’m always happy to hear from you.
