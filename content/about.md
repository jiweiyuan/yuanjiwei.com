Hi, I'm Jiwei Yuan.

I'm a professional software development engineer. I devoted myself to building Enterprise SaaS, Data-intensive applications, and Distributed Systems.

I'm a pragmatic learning hacker, I use Anki (spaced repetition) to improve my memorization and use Obsidian to practice incremental reading as well as incremental writing. Also, I will develop some tiny applications or plugins in my free time to improve my productivity.

By the way, I'm currently interested in how to build an intelligent system. Thus, I will commit some time to learn Probalistic Theory and Machine Learning Theory.

In this blog, I will share my thoughts on software applications, architecture, and engineering. And sometimes I will share what I learn from reading books about learning science and creativity psychology, of course, and my real personal experiences on how to pursue excellence.
