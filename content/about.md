Hi, I'm Jiwei Yuan.

I'm a professional software development engineer. I devoted myself to building Enterprise SaaS, Data-intensive applications, and Distributed Systems.

I'm a pragmatic learning hacker, I use Anki(spaced repetition) to improve my memorization and use Obsidian to practice incremental reading as well as incremental writing. Also, I will develop some tiny applications or plugins in my free time to improve my productivity.

I'm an individual researcher, I'm interested in how to build an intelligent system. Thus, I will commit some time to learn Probalistic Theory and Machine Learning Theory.
