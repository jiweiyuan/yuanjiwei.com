Hi, I'm Jiwei Yuan.

I'm a professional software development engineer.

I graduated in 2018 from [Shandong University](http://www.sdu.edu.cn/) with a bachelor's degree. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the [University of St Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/) from 2023 to 2024.

I have experience in Java, Golang, and JavaScript. Currently, I primarily focus on the backend development. I devoted myself to building Enterprise SaaS, Data-intensive applications, and Distributed Systems Application. 

I'm a pragmatic learning hacker. I'm curious about learning science and creativity psychology. I explore simple and high ROI approches to improve my learning and productity efficiency. I have share my experience and workflow to boost learning and productivity at [Learning Hacker](/posts/learning-hacker/) and [Knowledge Workflow](/posts/knowledge-workflow/).

In this blog, I will share my thoughts on programming, software applications, software architecture, and software engineering. And sometimes I will share some real personal experiences on how to pursue excellence.
