This blog will record my knowledge workflow as a software engineer.

#### Learning
RSS is a great way to keep up with the latest news and practices in your field. I currently subscribe many engineering blogs using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) and read them on [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/). [Engineering Blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs) is a great list of engineering blogs.

#### Writing
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes.
I use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write blog and [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) to write paper.
Use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to manage your references.
Use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check my grammar and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to polish my writing.

#### Diagramming
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a great tool for diagramming. Sometimes I also use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to draw UML diagrams.

#### Blogging
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) + [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) + [CloudFlare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) + [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/)

#### Community
[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is a great tool for online meeting. When I was in China, I used [Tencent Meeting](https://meeting.tencent.com/). When I was University of St Andrews, I primaryly use [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) to communicate with my classmates.
