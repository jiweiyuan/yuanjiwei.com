This blog will record my knowledge workflow toolbox as a software engineer.

#### Learning
RSS is a great way to keep up with the latest news and practices in your field. Currently, I subscribe to many engineering teams blogs and individual blogs using [Feedly](https://feedly.com/) and read them on [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/). [Engineering Blogs](https://github.com/kilimchoi/engineering-blogs) is a great list of engineering blogs. In addition, I find [YouTube](https://youtube.com) is a great resource for courses and lectures. For listening to podcasts, I use [Apple Podcasts](https://www.apple.com/apple-podcasts/). 

#### Writing
I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) to take notes, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) for blog and [Latex](https://www.latex-project.org/) for paper and book. I Use [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to manage your references. Besides that, I use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) to check my grammar and [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) to polish my writing.

#### Diagramming
[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is a great tool for diagramming. Sometimes I also use [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) to draw UML diagrams.

#### Blogging
Blogging is a great practice for improving your writing skills and building your personal brand. It can help you organize your thoughts and have a positive impact on your audience gradually. I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to write my blog using the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and host it on [GitHub](https://github.com/). I use [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) to build and deploy my blog websites. Additionaly, I use [Cloudflare R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) to host files like PDFs, and [PicGo](https://picgo.github.io/PicGo-Doc/en/) to upload images to [GitHub](https://github.com/jiweiyuan/images) and use their URL in my makdown file with the link https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jiweiyuan/images/master/xxx.


#### Community
[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) is a great tool for online meeting. When I was in China, I used [Tencent Meeting](https://meeting.tencent.com/). When I was University of St Andrews, I primaryly use [Microsoft Teams](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-teams/group-chat-software) to communicate with my classmates.
